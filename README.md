## ðŸ”¹ Getting Started (Run the Code)
**How to compile and run the CPU version **
g++ matrix_mul_cpu.cpp -o matrix_cpu -O2
./matrix_cpu

**How to Run the HIP GPU Version**
### Install HIP & ROCm (For AMD Instinct GPUs)
```bash
sudo apt install rocm-dev

Compile & Run the GPU-Accelerated Code
hipcc matrix_mul_hip.cpp -o matrix_gpu
./matrix_gpu

Note:

A GPU is hardware, but software needs to use it for specific tasks. Gaming, video editing, AI, and other high-performance applications offload processing (CPU offloads the complex tasks to GPU)to the GPU to improve speed and efficiency.
How the CPU and GPU Work Together?
The CPU handles general tasks, like:

Running the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Managing files, apps, and background tasks.
Handling logic-based tasks like AI decision-making.
The GPU accelerates specific tasks, like:

Rendering graphics for games, movies, and 3D modeling.
AI computations for machine learning.
Video editing & rendering for smoother playback.
Data science & big data processing in professional applications.
This teamwork between the CPU and GPU results in faster processing and reduced run time for tasks that need high-speed calculations.
